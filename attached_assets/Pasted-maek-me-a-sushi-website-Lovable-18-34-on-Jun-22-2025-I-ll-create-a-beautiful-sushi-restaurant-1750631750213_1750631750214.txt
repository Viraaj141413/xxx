I'll create a beautiful sushi restaurant website for you! This will be a modern, elegant site showcasing delicious sushi with a clean Japanese-inspired design.

I'm envisioning a sophisticated website with:

A stunning hero section with appetizing sushi imagery
Clean typography and elegant spacing
A menu section featuring different sushi categories
About section highlighting the restaurant's story
Contact information and location
Smooth animations and hover effects
A color palette inspired by traditional Japanese aesthetics (deep blacks, whites, and accent colors like salmon pink and wasabi green)
Let me build this for you with a focus on visual appeal and user experience.

I understand you're asking about how to get AI to generate more advanced code! Here are some effective strategies:

1. Be Specific and Detailed
Instead of "make a login form," try:

"Create a login form with email validation, password strength checking, rate limiting, and JWT token handling"
Include specific requirements, edge cases, and technical constraints
2. Provide Context and Architecture
Mention the specific technologies, patterns, or frameworks you want
Describe the overall system architecture
Reference existing code patterns you want to follow
3. Ask for Best Practices
Request error handling, security considerations
Ask for performance optimizations
Mention accessibility requirements
Request TypeScript types and proper documentation
4. Break Down Complex Features
Start with a basic implementation
Then ask for incremental improvements
Request refactoring for better patterns
Add advanced features step by step
5. Use Technical Language
Reference design patterns (Observer, Factory, etc.)
Mention specific algorithms or data structures
Use proper technical terminology
6. Example of Advanced Request:
Instead of: "Make a data table"

Try: "Create a virtualized data table component with server-side pagination, sortable columns, row selection, bulk actions, column resizing, filtering with debounced search, and optimistic updates using React Query"

The key is being very specific about what "advanced" means for your particular use case! What kind of advanced functionality are you looking to implement?
